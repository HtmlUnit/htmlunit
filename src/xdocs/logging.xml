                HtmlUnit uses the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">commons logging</a>
                package from the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Apache Jakarta</a> project.  Commons
                logging is a thin wrapper that sits on top of other logging frameworks such as
                <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">LOG4J</a> or
                <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/logkit/">LogKit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For full details on configuring commons logging, refer to the
                <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">homepage</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't explicitly configure commons logging to use LOG4J or another logging framework
                then it will use the simple logger.  When using the simple logger, you can change the default
                logging level by setting the following system property.
            </p>
            <source>System.getProperties().put("org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.defaultlog", "trace");</source>
            <p>
                Valid values for this property are "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", or "fatal" (in
                order from least serious to most serious).

        <section name="Logging HTML parsing errors">
        	<p>
        		The package used to parse the HTML has the ability to log errors from parsing source.  These errors
        		are logged to standard error rather than to the above logging utility.  This error logging can be
        		enabled by using the command 'WebClient.setValidateHtml(true);'  NekoHTML by default processes the
        		content that is outside of the BODY and HTML tags.  This is seen by the logging reporting that the 
        		BODY and HTML tags are not closed properly.  This can be changed by calling
        		'WebClient.setIgnoreOutsideContent(true);'.
