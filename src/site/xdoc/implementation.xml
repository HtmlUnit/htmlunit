                In most cases the implementation of HtmlUnit follows a test driven approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be able to stay in sync with the development of real browsers, we try to write
                tests in a way that enables us to compare the results of executing the tests with real
                browsers to our own results. This also directy leads to a test firsts approach - write
                the test; run the test with all real browsers and adjust the expectations, run the test
                with HtmlUnit and finally fix the implementation if needed. Additionally we try to make the
                test as small as possible to make the connetion between a failing test and the related
                implementation as direct as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important part for this approach is the class
                <a href="https://htmlunit.sourceforge.io/testapidocs/com/gargoylesoftware/htmlunit/WebDriverTestCase.html">WebDriverTestCase</a>.
                Please have a look at the javadoc to learn how you can switch between real browsers and HtmlUnit when running your tests.
