                A frequent question we get is "how do I test my JavaScript?".
                There is nothing really specific for using JavaScript, it is automatically processed.
                So, you just need to .getPage(), find the element to click(), and then check the result.
                Tests for complex JavaScript libraries are included in HtmlUnit test base, you can find it
                <a href="https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit/tree/master/src/test/java/org/htmlunit/libraries/">here</a>
                which is useful to get an idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually, you should wait a little, as HtmlUnit can finish before the AJAX response is
                retrieved from the server, please read <a href="https://www.htmlunit.org/faq.html#AJAXDoesNotWork">this FAQ</a>.

        <section name="Enable/Disable JavaScript support">
            <p>
                The JavaScript support is enabled per default like in real browsers.
            </p>

            <subsection name="Handling of JavaScript errors">
            <p>
                <strong>But:</strong> There is one major difference compared to real browsers - in 
                the default configuration HtmlUnit will
                stop JavaScript execution if an unhandled JavaScript error occurs. This is done
                because HtmlUnit was initially designed for testing where fail early is
                a good practice.<br></br>
                You can change this to silently (HtmlUnit will still log the exceptions)
                ignore the JavaScript exceptions (like in real browsers) by setting
                the option throwExceptionOnScriptError to false.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
 final WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
 webClient.getOptions.setThrowExceptionOnScriptError(false);

            <subsection name="Completely disable the JavaScript support">
            <p>
                For some use cases it might be helpful to completely disable the JavaScript support
                (e.g. for better performance and less memory usage).
                HtmlUnit offers two way to do this; you can completely disable JavaScript or only
                temporary.<br></br>
                To disable the JavaScript support (without the possibility to enable it for the WebClient
                later on) a special WebClient constructor is available. This is the most performance/resource
                effective solution.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
 WebClient webClient = new WebClient(BrowserVersion.FIREFOX, false, null, -1);
]]></source>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Temporary disable the JavaScript support">
            <p>
                By using the WebClientOptions it is possible to disable JavaScript support for a specific client
                at any time and enable it again later.
                However, this only disables the execution of the script tags and the triggering of event listeners.
                However, the JavaScript objects will still be created.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
 final WebClient webClient = new WebClient(BrowserVersion.FIREFOX);
 webClient.getOptions.setJavaScriptEnabled(false);
 ....
 webClient.getOptions.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
]]></source>
            </subsection>

            <p>
                If you like to check the state of the JavaScript support from your code it is recommended to use
                <a href="apidocs/org/htmlunit/WebClient.html#isJavaScriptEnabled--">WebClient#isJavaScriptEnabled()</a>
                because this checks both ways of disabling Javascript.

        <section name="Example: using Document.write()">
            <p>
                Lets say that we have a page containing JavaScript that will dynamically
                write content to the page.  The following html will dynamically generate
                five textfields and place them inside a table.  Each textfield will have
                a unique name created by appending the index to the string "textfield".
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
<html><head><title>Table sample</title></head><body>
    <form action='/foo' name='form1'>
    <table id="table1">
        <script type="text/javascript">
            for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                document.write("<tr><td>" + i
                    + "</td><td><input name='textfield" + i
                    + "' type='text'></td></tr>");
            }
        </script>
    </table></form>
</body></html>]]></source>
            
            <p>
                We would likely want to test that the five text fields were created so
                we could start with this.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
@Test
public void documentWrite() throws Exception {
    final WebClient webClient = new WebClient();

    final HtmlPage page = webClient.getPage("http://myserver/test.html");
    final HtmlForm form = page.getFormByName("form1");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        final String expectedName = "textfield" + i;
        Assert.assertEquals(
            "text", 
            form.<HtmlInput>getInputByName(expectedName).getTypeAttribute());
    }
}]]></source>
            <p>
                We might also want to check off-by-one errors by ensuring that 
                it didn't create "textfield0" or "textfield6".  Trying to get an 
                element that doesn't exist will cause an exception to be thrown
                so we could add this to the end of the previous test.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
try {
    form.getInputByName("textfield0");
    fail("Expected an ElementNotFoundException");

    // Expected path
}

try {
    form.getInputByName("textfield6");
    fail("Expected an ElementNotFoundException");
}
catch (final ElementNotFoundException e) {
    // Expected path

        <section name="Example: Watching for 'alerts'">
            <p>
                Often you want to watch alerts triggered by JavaScript.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
<html><head><title>Alert sample</title></head>
<body onload='alert("foo");'>
</body></html>]]></source>
            <p>
               Alerts are tracked by an AlertHandler which will be called whenever
               the JavaScript alert() function is called.  In the following test, 
               we register an alert handler which just saves all messages into a 
               list.  When the page load is complete, we compare that list of
               collected alerts with another list of expected alerts to ensure
               they are the same.
            </p>

            <source><![CDATA[
@Test
public void alerts() throws Exception {
    final WebClient webClient = new WebClient();

    final List collectedAlerts = new ArrayList();
    webClient.setAlertHandler(new CollectingAlertHandler(collectedAlerts));

    // Since we aren't actually manipulating the page, we don't assign
    // it to a variable - it's enough to know that it loaded.
    webClient.getPage("http://tciludev01/test.html");

    final List expectedAlerts = Collections.singletonList("foo");
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedAlerts, collectedAlerts);
}]]></source>
        </section>
        
        <section name="Prompts, Confirms and Status line messages">
            <p>
                Handling prompt dialogs, confirm dialogs and status line messages
                work in the same way as alerts.  You register a handler of the 
                appropriate type and it will get notified when that method is called.
                See WebClient.setPromptHandler(), WebClient.setConfirmHandler() and
                WebClient.setStatusHandler() for details on these.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Event handlers">
            <p>
                Most event handlers are already implemented: onload, onclick, ondblclick, onmouseup, onsubmit, onreadystatechange, ... 
                They will be triggered at the appropriate time just like in a "real browser".
            </p>
            <p>
                If the event that you wish to test is not yet supported then you can 
                directly invoke it through the ScriptEngine.  Note that while the script 
                engine is publicly 
                accessible, we do not recommend using it directly unless you have no
                other choice.  It is much better to manipulate the page as a user would
                by clicking on elements and shifting the focus around.
            </p>

        <section name="Run javascript inside the page/window">
            <p>
                Sometimes it is helpfull to execute javascript inside the current page e.g. to get the value of window properties
                or forcing some javascript functions to run. In general you can do everything you can do with a script tag inside
                the page and additionally get back the result of the invokation.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
String script = "window.name;";
String result = (String) page.executeJavaScript(script).getJavaScriptResult();
