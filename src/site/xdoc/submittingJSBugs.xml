				HtmlUnit has a good support for JavaScript which gets continuously improved,
				and test cases for complex libraries (Dojo, jQuery, Prototype,
				Google Web Toolkit, Yahoo User Interface and Sarissa) are already included.<br/>
				However, not all test cases succeed, and you would probably face an issue in real-life example.
            </p>
            <p>
				Before reporting an issue with JavaScript, it is very preferred if you 
				isolate the root cause, but just saying 'Dojo' or a given web site is not working, doesn't help much.<br/>
				To find the offending line, you can put <code>alert()</code> at various places,
				compare the result of HtmlUnit to a real browser (Internet Explorer or Firefox),
				and you will mostly be able to provide a tiny failing test case which contains
				few lines of JavaScript with or without Html (independent of the whole JavaScript library),
				please have a look at <a href="http://htmlunit.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/htmlunit/trunk/htmlunit/src/test/java/com/gargoylesoftware/htmlunit/html">some sample test cases</a>.<br/>
				Once the cause is identified, it is very likely to be fixed in a timely manner.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
				If you need any help in tracing, please don't hesitate to ask the team.
