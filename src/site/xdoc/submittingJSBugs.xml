				HtmlUnit has a good support for JavaScript which gets continuously improved,
				and test cases for complex libraries (Dojo, jQuery, Prototype,
				Google Web Toolkit, Yahoo User Interface and Sarissa) are already included.<br/>
				However, not all test cases succeed, and you would probably face an issue in real-life example.
            </p>
            <p>
				Before reporting an issue with JavaScript, it is very preferred if you 
				isolate the root cause, but just saying 'jQuery' or a given web site is not working, doesn't help much.<br/>
				To find the offending line, you can put <code>alert()</code> at various places,
				compare the result of HtmlUnit to a real browser (Internet Explorer or Firefox),
				and you will mostly be able to provide a tiny failing test case which contains
				few lines of JavaScript with or without HTML (independent of the whole JavaScript library),
				please have a look at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/htmlunit/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/htmlunit/src/test/java/com/gargoylesoftware/htmlunit/html/">some sample test cases</a>.<br/>
				Once the cause is identified, it is very likely to be fixed in a timely manner.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
				If you need any help in tracing, please don't hesitate to ask the team.

                The below are sample steps demonstrating putting 'alerts()' for a bug reported with HtmlUnit 2.7 and Dojo 1.4.
                Dojo is a complex JavaScript library, and you will mostly find it easier to debug simpler web applications.

                Please also note the exact bug may have already been fixed and you may get different result.

                The user complained that an error occurs:

net.sourceforge.htmlunit.corejs.javascript.EcmaError: TypeError: Cannot call method "getAttribute" of undefined
(http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.4.0/dojo-release-1.4.0/dojo/dojo.js#16(eval)#16)]]></source>
            <p>
                which means that in some_variable.getAttribute(), HtmlUnit evaluated it to 'undefined'
                during execution of that line.<br/><br/>
                The first thing to do it to be able to change the JavaScript/HTML source, which can be done by locally
                deploying the Dojo examples in this case, or to modify the incoming JavaScript code as mentioned 
                <a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/faq.html#HowToModifyRequestOrResponse">here</a>.<br/><br/>
                By looking into dojo.js line #16, it is compressed very long line, so we need to beautify it,
                again we can get the uncompressed version, modify the WebResponse, or using a beautifier 
                <a href="http://htmlunit.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/htmlunit/trunk/proxy/">proxy</a>.<br/><br/>
                To make it simpler for now, the uncompressed dojo-release-1.4.2-src.zip was locally deployed and the following test was run again:
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
@Test
public void dojoTest() throws Exception {
    final WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
    final List<String> collectedAlerts = new ArrayList<String>();
    webClient.setAlertHandler(new CollectingAlertHandler(collectedAlerts));

    try {
        webClient.getPage("http://localhost/dojo/dijit/tests/form/test_Button.html");
    }
    finally {
        webClient.closeAllWindows();
        for (final String alert : collectedAlerts) {
            System.out.println("ALERT: " + alert);
        }
    }
}
]]></source>
            <p>
                giving the error 
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[TypeError: Cannot call method "getAttribute" of undefined (http://localhost/dojo/dojo/_base/_loader/bootstrap.js#468(eval)#299)

at net.sourceforge.htmlunit.corejs.javascript.Interpreter.interpretLoop(Interpreter.java:1515)

at script(http://localhost/dojo/dojo/_base/_loader/bootstrap.js#468(eval):131)
            ]]></source>
            <p>
                By looking into bootstrap.js line #468, you would see
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
dojo["eval"] = function(scriptFragment){
    return d.global.eval ? d.global.eval(scriptFragment) : eval(scriptFragment); // line #468
}
]]></source>
            <p>
                We then add "alert(scriptFragment);" just before that line, and re-run the test, and since the alerted strings
                are too large, we print them to outside files
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
    private int counter = 1;
    public void dojoTest() throws Exception {

        ...

        for (String alert : collectedAlerts) {
            System.out.println("ALERT: " + alert);
            FileUtils.writeStringToFile(new File("path_to_dir\\testOutput_" + counter++ + ".txt"), alert);
        }
    }
]]></source>
            <p>
                then search for any line #299 with 'getAttribute()', you would see the below line for the file for dijit/_base/manager.js
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[dijit.byNode = function(node){
	return dijit.registry.byId(node.getAttribute("widgetId")); // line #299
};]]></source>
            <p>
                By putting 'alert(node)' just before that line, you will get 'undefined' alert.<br/><br/>
                Going back to the stack trace, we know that something.byNode() was called on #191, searching in the files again,
                you will see the below for the file for dijit/form/Button.js'
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[if(!this.dropDown){
    var dropDownNode = dojo.query("[widgetId]", this.dropDownContainer)[0];
    this.dropDown = dijit.byNode(dropDownNode); // line #191
    delete this.dropDownContainer;
}]]></source>
            <p>
                That means that dropDownNode was evaluated to 'undefined', which was passed to dijit.byNode().
                To further debug the issue of dojo.query() and since it is called many times, we change the calling code to: 
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[if(!this.dropDown){
    window.top.debugMe = true;  // ADDED FOR DEBUGGING
    var dropDownNode = dojo.query("[widgetId]", this.dropDownContainer)[0];
    window.top.debugMe = false;  // ADDED FOR DEBUGGING
    this.dropDown = dijit.byNode(dropDownNode); // line #191
    delete this.dropDownContainer;
}]]></source>
            <p>
                And add the below alerts in dojo/_base/query.js
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[d.query = function(query, root){
    ...
    var r = getQueryFunc(query)(root);
    if (window.top.debugMe)        // ADDED FOR DEBUGGING
       alert(getQueryFunc(query))  // ADDED FOR DEBUGGING
    ...
}]]></source>
            <p>
                you will find getQueryFunc() returns different value in HtmlUnit than with real browser.<br/><br/>
                
                You could follow that technique to debug further and reach a single line where HtmlUnit incorrectly behaves, and provide minimal test case.
