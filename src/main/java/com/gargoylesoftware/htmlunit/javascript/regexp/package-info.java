/**
 * This package contains improvement to Rhino native RegExp based on JDK 1.4 regular expression support.
 * Currently only a small part of RegExp functionalites have been improved but work will continue on this.
 * Optimally this package should disappear once Rhino has fixed its RegExp bugs and performance problems.
