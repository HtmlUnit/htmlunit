/**
 * <p>A handler for attachments, which represent pages received from the server which contain
 * {@code Content-Disposition=attachment} headers. Normally pages are loaded inline: clicking on
 * a link, for example, loads the linked page in the current window. Attached pages are different
 * in that they are intended to be loaded outside of this flow: clicking on a link prompts the
 * user to either save the linked page, or open it outside of the current window, but does not
 * load the page in the current window.</p>
 *
 * <p>HtmlUnit complies with the semantics described above when an <code>AttachmentHandler</code> has
 * been registered with the {@link org.htmlunit.WebClient} via
 * {@link org.htmlunit.WebClient#setAttachmentHandler(AttachmentHandler)}. When
 * no attachment handler has been registered with the <code>WebClient</code>, the semantics described
 * above to not apply, and attachments are loaded inline. By default, <code>AttachmentHandler</code>s
 * are not registered with new <code>WebClient</code> instances.</p>
