 * A listener for WebWindowEvent's.
 * <p>
 * This listener informs when a new window is opened, when the content of a window changes
 * or when a window is closed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Caution: The WebClient creates (and opens) the initial window as part of the construction
 * process. This implies, the initial window is already open at the time you attach this listener.
 * Therefore you will receive no open event for this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Caution: Frames and also iFrames are handled as separate windows. Therefore the listener is also
 * called for each and every containing (i)Frame when e.g. closing a {@link TopLevelWindow}.
