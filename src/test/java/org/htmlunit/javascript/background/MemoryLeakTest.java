/**
 * <p>Tests for memory leaks. This test passes when run independently in Eclipse or via
 * Maven (mvn test -Dtest=MemoryLeakTest), but not when all tests are run via Maven
 * (mvn test). Note that this probably constitutes a false positive, meaning that the
 * window isn't leaked in this situation -- we just can't get the JVM to GC it because
 * there is no surefire way to force complete garbage collection.</p>
 *
 * <p>All suspected memory leaks should be verified with a profiler before a fix and/or
 * unit test is committed. In JProfiler, for example, you can run a unit test and tell
 * the profiler to keep the VM alive when it has finished running; once it has finished
 * running you can go to the Heap Walker, take a snapshot of the heap, sort the resultant
 * table by class name and find the class you're interested in, double-click on it, choose
 * to view References to instances of this class, then right-click on the class and choose
 * Show Paths to GC Root. This will give you a list of references which need to be
 * eliminated. Once you have a fix, repeat the above steps in order to verify that the
 * fix works.</p>
