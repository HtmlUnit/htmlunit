## introduction

htmx allows you to access  [AJAX](https://htmx.org/docs#ajax), [CSS Transitions](https://htmx.org/docs#css_transitions),
[WebSockets](https://htmx.org/docs#websockets) and [Server Sent Events](https://htmx.org/docs#sse) 
directly in HTML, using [attributes](https://htmx.org/reference#attributes), so you can build 
[modern user interfaces](https://htmx.org/examples) with the [simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) and 
[power](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) of hypertext

htmx is small ([~10k min.gz'd](https://unpkg.com/htmx.org/dist/)), 
[dependency-free](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/package.json),
[extendable](https://htmx.org/extensions) & 
IE11 compatible

## motivation

* Why should only `<a>` and `<form>` be able to make HTTP requests?
* Why should only `click` & `submit` events trigger them?
* Why should only GET & POST be available?
* Why should you only be able to replace the *entire* screen?

By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a 
[hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)

## quick start

```html
  <!-- Load from unpkg -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.5.0" ></script>
  <!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->
  <button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
    Click Me
  </button>
```

The [`hx-post`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-post) and [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap) attributes tell htmx:

> "When a user clicks on this button, issue an AJAX request to /clicked, and replace the entire button with the response"

htmx is the successor to [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org)

## contributing

* please write code, including tests, in ES5 for [IE 11 compatibility](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39902809/support-for-es6-in-internet-explorer-11)
* please include test cases in [`/test`](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/tree/dev/test) and docs in [`/www`](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/tree/dev/www)
* if you are adding a feature, consider doing it as an [extension](https://htmx.org/extensions) instead to
keep the core htmx code tidy
* development pull requests should be against the `dev` branch, docs fixes can be made directly against `master`
* No time? Then [become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/bigskysoftware#sponsors)

### hacking guide

to develop htmx locally, you will need to install the development dependencies:

* `npm install`

and then run a web server in the root (easiest with python):

* `python3 -m http.server
`

you can then run the test suite by navigating to:

<http://0.0.0.0:8000/test/>

at this point you can modify `/src/htmx.js` to add features, and then add tests in the appropriate area under `/test`

* `/test/index.html` - the root test page from which all other tests are included
* `/test/attributres` - attribute specific tests
* `/test/core` - core functionality tests
* `/test/core/regressions.js` - regresssion tests
* `/test/ext` - extension tests
* `/test/manual` - manual tests that cannot be automated

htmx use the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework, the [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion frame work, 
and [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/releases/v11.1.1/fake-xhr-and-server/) to mock out AJAX requests.  They are all OK.

longing for a hypertext<br/>
